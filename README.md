VPS.net PHP API

The existing VPS.net API PHP wrapper is less than ideal to my coding preference(s).
The intent of this repository is to expose PHP API in a way that can be dropped into other projects quickly.

This repository is *not* provided, sponsored, or maintained by VPS.net in any way. Use at your OWN risk.
